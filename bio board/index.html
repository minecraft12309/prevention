        <h1>What is a Disease?</h1>
        <p>A disease is a condition that impairs normal functioning of an organism, typically manifested by specific signs and symptoms. It can affect any part of the body and can result from various causes, such as infections (caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites), genetic mutations, environmental factors, or autoimmune responses. Diseases can be acute (short-term) or chronic (long-term) and may range from mild to life-threatening. They are often classified into categories like infectious, genetic, degenerative, metabolic, and autoimmune diseases.
            Understanding and managing diseases involves diagnosis, treatment, and prevention, often through medical interventions or lifestyle changes.</p>

    <h1>Preventive Measures</h1>
    <p>Preventive measures are actions taken to avoid the onset or spread of diseases, aimed at maintaining health and reducing the risk of illness. These measures can be broadly categorized into three types:
    </p>
    <h2>Primary Prevention</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
       <li>Vaccination: Immunizing against infectious diseases such as measles, polio, and influenza.<br><br></li>
        <li>Healthy Lifestyle: Regular exercise, balanced nutrition, and maintaining a healthy weight to prevent conditions like heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers.<br><br></li>
        <li>Avoiding Risk Factors: Quitting smoking, limiting alcohol consumption, and avoiding exposure to pollutants and harmful substances.<br><br></li>
        <li>Hygiene Practices: Handwashing, sanitization, and using personal protective equipment (e.g., masks) to prevent the spread of infections.<br><br></li>
        </ul>
   </p>
  <h2>Secondary Prevention</h2>
  <p>
    <ul>
    <li>Screening and Early Detection: Regular check-ups, cancer screenings (e.g., mammograms, colonoscopies), and blood pressure or cholesterol monitoring to catch diseases in their early stages when they are more treatable.<br><br></li>
    <li>Health Education: Raising awareness about signs, symptoms, and risk factors of diseases to encourage early medical intervention.<br><br></li>
  </ul></p>
  <h2>Tertiary Prevention</h2>
  <p> 
    <ul>
    <li>Managing Chronic Diseases: Ongoing treatment and rehabilitation for people with chronic conditions (e.g., diabetes management, physical therapy after a stroke) to prevent complications or worsening.<br><br></li>
    <li>Medication Adherence: Ensuring patients follow prescribed treatments for conditions like hypertension or asthma to prevent severe outcomes.<br><br></li></ul></p>
